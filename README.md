# SuperCard DSOne Manual/Setup Guide

## Initial Setup

##### [Download the DSOne-SDHC Evolution kernel](http://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/SuperCard/DSONE_SDHC_DSONEi/SuperCard_DSONE_SDHC_EOS_sp6_20121206.zip)

1.  Confirm your card is formatted to fat32. If you're on Windows and using a 64GB SD, you can use [guiformat](http://ridgecrop.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) to do this.
2. Unzip the files in the kernel zip, and copy them to the root of the sd card. This is all for installation.

## Further Setup - (Cheats)

The Evolution kernel has support for cheats, but doesn't come with any cheats included by default. They needed to be added manually in the form of a usrcheat.dat file. If you don't care about cheats you can skip this part of setup.

1. One of the most up-to-date usrcheat.dat's can be [found here.](https://bitbucket.org/DeadSkullzJr/nds-i-cheat-databases/src/master/Cheat%20Databases/)

2. After you have download the usrcheat.dat file, copy it to the `_dsone` directory on your DSOne's SD card.
